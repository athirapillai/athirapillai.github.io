          <h4>For a sponsored project in a Usability Engineering Course, our theme was "Citizens helping in their communities". 
            To promote this theme, my team and I created LocalHero, an application that will allow people
            to easily give back to their community while winning rewards. </h4>

                <p> People often want to help out in their community and volunteer, but they tend to have trouble finding
                  a volunteering activity related to their interests and staying motivated to continuously volunteer.</p>
                <p>Several applications already exist that are devoted toward networking volunteering activities, but many of these applications only use a potential user’s want to help as incentive for using the service. This sadly does not tend to attract more users to an application that can benefit from as many users as possible.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, local charities and charitable organizations need as much as help as they can get for
                  their events, but it's difficult finding people to help with each and every event.</p>

                <p>Our team created an aesthetically pleasing prototype of the LocalHero application that provides

                <br>
                <p>- LocalHero has an aspect of gamification and a reward system to help bring in more users that would like to help. <br>
                  - This application allows charitable organizations to publish events to a public platform. Users, dubbed Heroes, will have the ability to view a list of events occurring in their area and accept events in which they would like to partake. <br>
                  - When a Hero reaches a certain amount of points, he/she can receive coupons or gift cards as they level up from sponsoring companies, such as Target or Walmart. </p>

      <h2>First Step: <strong>Research</strong></h2>
    <br><br>
		<h6><strong>Research Questions:</strong><br><br>
			<ul><li><strong>What other similar applications exist that would be our competition?</strong><br>
			Hypothesis: There are many applications out there that offer connections to volunteers, including apps like GiveGab, Golden, Volunteer Finder, and One Today, but we will go beyond the competition with the incentive for users to continuously complete tasks.</li><br>
				<li><strong>What types of sponsors would assist in providing rewards for greater levels?</strong><br>
			Hypothesis: There would be coupons, discount codes, or gift cards for local or franchise businesses, possibly broken up by area code or state. </li><br>
				<li><strong>What are other ways to push users to reusing the application to complete more tasks?</strong><br>
			Hypothesis: The application would update or refresh rewards periodically to keep users interested in the application. Levelling up will also make them a more well-rounded “Local Hero”.</li><br>
				<li><strong>What is our application’s key demographic?</strong><br>
			Hypothesis: Our application’s demographic would focus on more socially involved users, probably younger and more active, more involved in volunteering, but also those wanting to volunteer with some kind of small reward for helping.</li><br>
				<li><strong>Does this key demographic require a simpler interface?</strong><br>
			Hypothesis: The demographic for this application would likely not find trouble with most existing interfaces, but for users that are very young, a bit of simplification of the application would be necessary.</li><br>
				<li><strong>How would you prevent someone from falsely gaining points?</strong><br>
			Hypothesis: We would have some form of vetting process, perhaps conducted by the organizations we work with, for people putting up events so that we would not have someone dishonestly farming points by making fake events and saying that they completed them.</li></ul> </h6>
      <br>

		<h2>Second Step: <strong>Scenarios</strong></h2><br>
		
      <img src="images/scenarios.png" class="img-responsive center-block" height="80%" width="80%" alt="scenarios"> </div>
    <br>
    <br>
	  
	  <h2>Third Step: <strong>Storyboards/Wireframes</strong></h2><br>
	  
	   <img src="images/localherowireframes.png" class="img-responsive center-block" height="80%" width="80%" alt="scenarios"> 
	  <br><br>
	
	<h2 style="color: #24C18B">LocalHero: <strong>ITERATION 2</strong></h2><br><br>
      <h2>First Step: <strong>Target User Populations</strong></h2>
    <br>
	<h6>
		<strong>There are two kinds of target populations in the LocalHero project: users and charitable organizations. </strong>
		<br><br><ul><li>Within the users, the target population includes everyone who has a smartphone or tablet. They should be capable of working on certain tasks and have the responsibility of participating in volunteer events regardless of their gender, race, and religion. The target population’s age mostly lies between 15 to 60. Teenagers who are below 15 years old are likely to have less interest in volunteering, and people above 60 are likely to be unfamiliar with using new technology such as smartphones and apps. </li>
		<br><br><li>The other target population is charitable organizations that host volunteer events. Any organizations who would like to host events beneficial to the community are welcome, but we will mostly focus on charitable organizations, such as charities or organizations fundraising for a good cause. </li></ul>
	  </h6>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h6><strong>Our project will consist of users representing organizations seeking volunteers to help with charitable events and users that will access the app in order to research and volunteer for these events. So to expect appropriate use of the application and to try to achieve the most useful data for usability testing, we have created these hypotheses:</strong>
<br><br>
		  <ul><li>We believe that users of this application will be able to navigate through the application without getting lost more than once.</li>
<br>
			  <li>We believe that users of this application hoping to represent organizations will understand all or above 90% of the information needed to register a charitable organization to the application and be able to create an organizational account without needing to pull up extra documentation or access email lists for their organization.</li>
<br>
			  <li>We believe the users of this application will be able to use the coupon and gift card codes given to them on the application.</li></ul>
 <br><br>
		  
		  <strong>From these hypotheses, we can create these research questions:</strong>
		  <br><br>
		  <ul><li>How well can users navigate the application's pages?</li><br>
			  <li>Do most users that represent organizations have the knowledge on how to register an organization and create events for that organization?</li><br>
			  <li>Can most volunteering users for the application appropriately use virtual coupons and discount codes?</li></ul><br><br>

		  <strong>Validation</strong><br>
		  <ul><li>These hypotheses and research questions ask things of the users that can be answered, as many of them are either yes or no. We can answer hopefully all of these questions through usability studies as they ask about the behaviors and knowledge of the potential users for this application, an observable and testable series of questions.
			  </li></ul>

	  <h2>Second Step: <strong>Data Collection Methods</strong></h2>
	   <img src="images/datacollection.png" class="img-responsive center-block" height="80%" width="80%" alt="data"> 
	  <br><br>
	  
	 <h2>Third Step: <strong>Updated Wireframes &amp; Documentation</strong></h2>
	  <br><br>
	  <h6>We believe gamification is a powerful tool that often goes overlooked. Thus, we came up with additional ways to 
		  gamify our app's experience. 
		  <br><br><strong>Upon creating an account, a volunteer, or Local Hero, is able to select a superhero avatar that
		  will represent them. The more volunteering events they partake in, the more badges their superhero is awarded.</strong>
		  <br>Badges represent weapons and gadgets that their superhero receives. These badges and superhero avatars are displayed below:</h6>

      <h2><strong>Data Collection Analysis</strong></h2><br>
		<img src="images/dataanalysis.png" class="img-responsive center-block" height="80%" width="80%" alt="dataanalysis"><br>
	  <h2><strong>Future Work</strong></h2><br>
	  <h6>LocalHero has huge potential for growth and additional features. From adding mini-games to the application with the superhero avatars to creating a fully-blown superhero community with users of the app meeting in LocalHero-hosted events, the possibilities are endless. We focused on the goal to continue making LocalHero easier to use, more enjoyable, and continuously in use by both volunteers and charitable organizations. <br><br>Some future work and design implications include:<br><br>
		  <ul><li>Conducting interviews with other sponsoring businesses to diversify rewards, perhaps even local businesses in the area</li><br>
			  <li>Conducting usability tests for representatives of charitable organizations and not just the volunteers</li><br>
			  <li>Exploring additional gamification elements, such as mini-games whenever a volunteer earns a new superpower badge or animations that are applied to the superhero to make it more lively </li><br>
			  <li>Adding a live-messaging inbox so that volunteers and representatives can talk to each other easily</li></ul>
	  </h6>
	  <br><br>
	  <h2><strong>Final Demo</strong></h2><br>
	  <h6>For our final high-fidelity prototype, we used Principle software. The final demo video below shows three scenarios:<br><br>
		  <ul><li>The first scenario will show a new user named Lydia creating an account as a new volunteer. </li><br>
			  <li>The second scenario will show Lydia signing back into her account after some time. She’s now a Level 3 hero who wants to check the rewards she’s accumulated.</li><br>
			  <li>Finally, the last scenario will show Li, a representative of the charitable organization Centre Foundation, sign back into her account.</li></ul></h6><br><br>
